git reset:
is a good option when you realize that the changes being made to a particular local branch should be somewhere else. 
You can reset and move to the desired branch without losing your file changes.

git revert:
is a good option for reverting changes pushed to a remote repository. 
Since this command creates a new commit, you can safely get rid of your mistakes without rearranging the commit history for everyone else.
